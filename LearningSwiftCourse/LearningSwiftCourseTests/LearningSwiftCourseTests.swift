    //Since struct instances are allocated on stack, and class instances are allocated on heap, structs can sometimes be drastically faster, but it really depends on how many values you're storing and the size / structure of them.
    
    //However, you should always measure it yourself and decide based on your unique use case.
    //Consider the following example, which demonstrates 2 strategies of wrapping Int data type (e.g. as part of a mathematics library)

    //Note #2: as someone mentioned that in real-world scenarios, there will be likely more than 1 field in a struct, I have added tests for structs/classes with 10 fields instead of 1. Surprisingly, results don't vary much.
